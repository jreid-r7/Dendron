Achieved
Has been learning about the whole system. Has a general idea of what talks to what (in terms of services). Has got an idea of what each service does and why it exists. Can tackle problems better in terms of where to start - can get there quicker without having to flail about through code. Better handle on our tooling e.g. git. Better idea of coding itself including refactoring and cleaner code. Generally getting to grips with Agile and the SDLC. Coming to grips with velocity and with testing.

Dan has made a good start and continues to work well both alone and with othe members of the team. He asks questions and acts upon the infomration given.
