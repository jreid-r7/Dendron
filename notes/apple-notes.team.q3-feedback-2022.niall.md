This quarter has really just been a continuation of the last. Niall has work consistently on the eIDP group sync piece and has also had some work to do helping to get the new group sync functionality integrated with the new SSO flow UI work. The SSO workflow was meant to be UX/UI only but this team noticed issues which required remediation. This ended up with an injection which Niall then drove as far as the backend work was concerned. Niall has shown commitment and perserverence in the face of some significant technical challenges and has worked well with other teams to achieve the current project outcome. Communication with PM has been more frequent.

 He continues to show a commitment to picking up issues from the support Slack channels. He also repsonds to code reviews with pertinent comments and suggestions.

Niall has demonstrated the progress of the group sync feature regularly in sprint demos. A development goal continues to be to take things learned from day to day work or background reading and prepare a tech talk from these.

Highlight - group sync almost out the door.
