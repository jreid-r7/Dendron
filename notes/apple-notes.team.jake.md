What defines good or worthwhile work?
Does the ask make sense? Was I just blindly told to do something. Going above and beyond? 
16-8 recent deliveries - there was an ask and with regards to that we can evaluate the ask to determine what was worthwhile. Not having to go backwards on things too much. Delivering the feature desired, taking into account NFRs.

How does work relate to you, others and society?
Develops himself, building himself up, not doing the same thing over and over again. Enjoyment, a job he likes, not stressful. The team is important. Keeping those other people happy. Contributing towards cybersecurity generally, but this aspect not so important. We don't treat the infection just the symptoms.
16-8 People need work. Some think if they won the lottery they could just quit but it often doesn't end well. Work helps and adds value to me personally. There are some jobs that don't and we should endeavour to have works that is valuable. 

What do experience, growth, and fulfillment have to do with work?
Fulfillment - don't want to be a cog in the wheel or a zombie. Need to be getting something back.
Growth - promotion not a primary focus - growth - want to be a better software developer.
Experience - finding what he can do or where he belongs
