Matthew started the year with the goal of becoming comfortable with CSS, styling, accessibility, etc. He has been chipping away at that and that has had impact showing the need for a custom accordion UI component. This led to conversations with UX and accessibility folks and showed a need within the org for this. It is one of the few places within platform home that we can use the keyboard to navigate.

  

Matthew understands that he should be experimenting more, however it has been difficult as work comes from multiple sources and many things are 'high priority'. He is justifiably proud of how he approached Vite and its adoption into UI. He took the opportunity to revisit with UX and the opportunity for a rewrite. Many conversations led to the idea of introducing a build tool. There were many differences in build methods depending on where in the code you were working. He tried a couple of tools and settled on Vite. He experimented on the back ofÂ  conversations with immediately impacted peers and found it was more than good enough to use. He also managed a tech talk. He has already begun his next experiment to improve UI notifications on the Platform using toast notifications.

He is actively looking for places to rewrite/refactor troublesome code, i.e RBAC entry-point and separating fetching for each tab on the UI.

  

Matthew has struggled with understanding the edges of our frontend infrastructure - how and why is R7's code build the way it is? Initially he just jumped in but has been taking a step back to understand the R7 UI idiosyncrasies and this has helped. The CSS issues in R7 UI caused the most pain - chatting to PXE first to understand their build tools would have made that easier. I would definitely encourage Matthew to continue this approach and keep talking. He has stepped outside his comfort zone with regards to communicating with UX and stakeholders.

  

There is room to expand on the introduction of best practice and better tech in terms of value and learning - making PoCs and doing tech talks. Has started on the toast notification PoC to show its value and what it would look like. Growth will come from this.

  

  

What has worked well for us? - we are candid, being open and honest. The need to demonstrate or validate ideas was good feedback. It has been good that I have reached out to others and hearing what they have to say.

  

What do you need from me for success? - more of what we have talked about and going more in depth.

  

What feedback for me? - we are addressing how we are doing things, addressing different opinions and looking at the effectiveness of our practice. Nothing "bad" or in need of major improvement. Remain open to conversations and feedback. Let's get the definition of done, done.
