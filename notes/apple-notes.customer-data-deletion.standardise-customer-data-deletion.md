There is a wide disparity across the platform regarding what happens when a license is disabled. Products have a range of solutions from manual to automated. There is no consistency.
There is a de-provision API which can only be accessed if disabled.
We need to delete on subscription churn taking into account data retention policies. We will then tell products when they can delete data. We will only build this once we have buy-in from product.
