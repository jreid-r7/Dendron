* Talk to PM about things like EKS - we need to push back and get prioritised backlog actioned - Chat to Mark F about what is needed to accelerate the EKS uptake for prod
* Start building a story to attract talent internally

We need to get over the "RBAC Bump"

* Ulrich needs an overview or understanding of the sorts of team meetings that are working or not working. Sprint planning, retros, etc. Who attends, what are they for?
  Are people attending things that could be PM only?


Pulse check on this stuff mid to end January
