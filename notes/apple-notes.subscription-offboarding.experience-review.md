Expiry dates have been historically inaccurate due to no information available on the context of a renewal. This is impacting the ability to give a good user experience. Platform can now be aware of whether or not there is a renewal.

Notifications snoozing - individual level only the user, platform admins may disable for all.

How do we access the renewal info in platform?
How do we implement these notifications with the snooze facility? We will need to store info - cookies? DB record? User profile?
- Probably cookies for individual, different mechanism for product admin.
