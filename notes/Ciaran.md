## Overview

Ciaran has been a key player this year. We have had a very long running project with considerable UI complexity and Ciaran has shown fantastic leadership on getting this project over the line. He pushes for the correct experience, he doesn't accept sub-standard work, he works through ambiguity to find the correct solution. He has tremendous attention to detail and technical skill. He is also well able to work with others and drive them forward towards correct solutions. He has also taken the time to make certain necessary customisations of components available to other teams within Rapid7.

In terms of RBAC he essentially owns a huge part of the system. This system has perplexed many other engineers. He is driven to get things done, and done well.

### Outside of RBAC

He works a lot with the DCM/Agent folks giving them assistance and guidance. He is always available for this type of thing. He has also given valuable guidance to our new engineers and is consistently available for them.

Recent Project Logo work for the ASM project saw Ciaran jump into unfamiliar territory and became a cross-functional facilitator who communicated well and helped remove road blocks, driving that project forward.

He identifies problems with requirements, raise issues early with the correct people e.g. recent work with the log search component. He understands how components like that interract with the wider system and the contract with the backend. He can course correct early and help prevent the need for rework.

## Feedback received

**Shows Empathy with End Users and the wider Platform:** He actively puts himself in the position of end users . He delivers pixel perfect experiences and always considers the wider context and ensures each experience makes sense and matches our wider design language and patterns.

**Outstanding User Experience:** Consistently advocating for the end user in all projects and decisions. His going above and beyond ensures that every feature is intuitive, ultimately improving the user experience. There are rarely any rough edges or half measures taken with features Ciaran implements. From the smallest interaction to singlehandedly re-theming the RBAC experience without being prompted, he shows care and diligence in all aspects.

**Delivery of Complex Feature Sets:** Successfully navigating ambiguity in acceptance criteria, he consistently delivers of high-quality features with little rework. He collaborates with the team, with UX and PM very effectively to ensure execution. Draws others together at the right time as well to get rid of roadblocks.

**Providing Feedback to Other Engineers:** Offering constructive feedback to peers always, typically seeing things others donâ€™t when coming to the final user experience. He also does well at critiquing work outside his area of expertise, like the ASM project, MSSP etc, with a focus on enhancing overall experience.

**Persistence in the Face of Roadblocks:** Ciaran remains focused and determined when encountering challenges. His outstanding contributions to RBAC speak for themselves. He dispatched any and all bugs that came his way in the final stages of RBAC delivery; this was extremely commendable and surely has not gone unnoticed by the team at large. He seeks solutions rather than gets discouraged.

## Moving forward

As we move into 2025 the role of the Platform UI engineering team will be changing somewhat. The Platform UI will be becoming more of a product in its own right. We will need engineers with seniority who are capable of driving the Platform UI forward and provide technical leadership and who can work with other teams to drive adoption. We need people like Ciaran who are willing to support the people around them and to work collaboratively with PM and UX to ensure that projects are not only well executed, but are aligned with customer needs and project goals.
