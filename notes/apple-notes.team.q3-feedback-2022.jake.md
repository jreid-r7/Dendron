This quarter has involved many with members of the team about design, standards, and best practices. Along with these Jake has helped steer org level RBAC.  He has also been keeping an eye on upcoming work and tech debt, reminding team about these.

Org Level RBAC has helped Jake get more involved with design and working with other teams and in getting his voice out there a bit.  He has put forward a couple of tech talks.  He was apprehensive about going more to the fore but has handled this well.

Jake would like to develop his time management and reach out sooner when feeling bogged down.  Could spend a little more time looking at personal goals and self development.

Jake shows that he is thinking about the quality of code the team produces, the quality of our processes and good ticket management. He will raise issues as he sees them and try to take ownership when appropriate.
