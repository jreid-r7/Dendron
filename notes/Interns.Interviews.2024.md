## Jack Gibson

Interested in Metasploit and listens to podcasts related to security.

### String reversal - used a stack

Asked to do again without stack - did reverse for loop

\> 0 - knew off by one errors.

Splitting to numerics and alphabetical - thinking about unicode. Two ifs - knows about switch - maybe not enough conditions to warrant a switch.

Moved to implementation and did a good job. Was able to move to an array based approach.

### Coin balance

Got the binary idea with 3 turns fairly quickly.

Took some prompting and got to the 3, 3, 2 solution with two turns.

### Melting candles

Plenty of prompting - understood the solution. Started to think about generalising the problem.

## James Bothwell

### String reversal

Really nice double ended solution with a temp variable. Good understanding of potential issues with assignment cost. Able to optimise the double ended while condition for odd length strings. Knew Java strings are immutable.

### Fibonacci

Good logical work through. Quick to understand limitations and problems with their idea and potential solution.

### Coins

Brute force - worked out quickly 1 - 7 iterations

More efficient - moved to binary nice and quickly 3 iterations

2 iteration solution - he had an intuitive idea that groups of 3 would work. Was surprised that he came to the answer.

## John McKee

### String reversal

Decent stab - listens to guidance, spotted issues, did an n iteration solution then worked to n / 2.

Could also describe a bubble sort - wasn't convinced by the implementation, however.

###Â Coin balance

Brooklyn 99?

Quick jump to the binary solution.
4 -> 4
2 -> 2
1 -> 1

Tried to discuss brute force, but he was still more efficient than 7! Got iterations.

Was asked to find a solution that does 2 iterations every time. Find a different way of splitting suggested.
3 -> 3 first
Got there

### Candles

Intuitively jumped to 1/2 and 1/4 for the end state and derived 3 hours from that.

## Minsur Choi

### String reversal

Quite clear pseudo code. First person to mention exceptions.

Reasonable understanding of the concepts of strings and arrays but needed prompting. Tendency to maybe over-complicate ideas in his head.

Good conversations and interaction.

### Gold bar problem

1st pass straightforward 4 cuts. Then started to think about how to do fewer cuts. Stuck on dividing into five parts. Got 3 cuts with disgonal lines. Hinted with the term transaction. 

Really good questions at the end showing appropriate curiosity.

## Niamh Mason

### String reversal

Nice solution where we take each char and prepend to the output string. 

Super clarity of thought. Worked through a really good char solution using no temp index. 

### Fibonacci

Has solved before. Knew about the special cases. Introduced a bug in her loop with the start index. Worked through rigorously.

### Gold bars

Straight to 4 cuts, guessed there was a better way. Initially fixated on producing 5 pieces.

### Candles

Overthought initially. Worked out a solution reasonably quickly.

## Rhianne Bassett

### String reversal

Quick to come to reverse iteration. Take char at index and add to new string. index decreasing each time. Append char to result. Was able to optimise using char arrays.

Norman's extension to count alphabetic characters and count the numbers. Talked through well, she's very conversational and relatable.

### Gold bars

Straight to four cuts. Really got caught up and missed the notion that she could take the 1/5 back off the worker. We got there.
