## Jack Gibson

Interested in Metasploit and listens to podcasts related to security.

### String reversal - used a stack

Asked to do again without stack - did reverse for loop

\> 0 - knew off by one errors.

Splitting to numerics and alphabetical - thinking about unicode. Two ifs - knows about switch - maybe not enough conditions to warrant a switch.

Moved to implementation and did a good job. Was able to move to an array based approach.

### Coin balance

Got the binary idea with 3 turns fairly quickly.

Took some prompting and got to the 3, 3, 2 solution with two turns.

### Melting candles

Plenty of prompting - understood the solution. Started to think about generalising the problem.

## James Bothwell

### String reversal

Really nice double ended solution with a temp variable. Good understanding of potential issues with assignment cost. Able to optimise the double ended while condition for odd length strings. Knew Java strings are immutable.

### Fibonacci

Good logical work through. Quick to understand limitations and problems with their idea and potential solution.

### Coins

Brute force - worked out quickly 1 - 7 iterations

More efficient - moved to binary nice and quickly 3 iterations

2 iteration solution - he had an intuitive idea that groups of 3 would work. Was surprised that he came to the answer.

## John McKee

### String reversal

Decent stab - listens to guidance, spotted issues, did an n iteration solution then worked to n / 2.

Could also describe a bubble sort - wasn't convinced by the implementation, however.

###Â Coin balance

Brooklyn 99?

Quick jump to the binary solution.
4 -> 4
2 -> 2
1 -> 1

Tried to discuss brute force, but he was still more efficient than 7! Got iterations.

Was asked to find a solution that does 2 iterations every time. Find a different way of splitting suggested.
3 -> 3 first
Got there

### Candles

Intuitively jumped to 1/2 and 1/4 for the end state and derived 3 hours from that.
