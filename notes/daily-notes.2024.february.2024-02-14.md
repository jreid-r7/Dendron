## EASM Sync

What are the missing requirements?
This will be a licensed product with it's own SKU
For existing VM customers
Looking at the existing tile model but might be strange - can it be treated as a product but visualised as a side menu item?
Could it be an add on for other products later?
Lots of to-ing and fro-ing. Will be sold alongside an IVM product license so will sit beside one of those. Will data be shared from subsequently purchased consoles?
