## Morning

<!-- Morning Tasks -->

What I need to do today:

1. Defects from bug bash - lots of UI issues, some are blockers. What UI resource do we have to work on those?
2. What is the lift to get products running their migration scripts? We have about 1000 customers that are single org and could be migrated now. Let's reach out and get a measure of that.
