What defines good or worthwhile work?
Well researched work, taking something you are not familiar with and understanding it is satisfying. Being able to communicate results to the team - wiki, demo, etc. Something that is delivered, is working, is being used, can be maintained.

How does work relate to you, others, and society?
Personally it is interesting.

What do experience, growth, and fulfilment have to do with work?
Growth and experience are linked - one leads to the other. Experience is very important and comes with time. Learning the project you are working on. A new job you would be starting again but experience leads to confidence. Growth can decline when resting on experience. You need to go and look for it after a time. Fulfillment - what do I take from my own work? Small to medium size, seeing them through, delivering to a high standard.

----------

An early work experience that influenced you.
Placement year - first time given some autonomy to lead a small thing. Amalgamated swagger UI - pet project for a while.

An experience that drove your interests.
Performance limitations of the SQS consumer - cropped up two years ago. Forced a look at the internal workings of these queues and how the annotation works under the hood.

An achievement or high point in your development.
Possibly yet to come with the group sync stuff but nothing yet.

A challenge or hurdle you overcame.
Okta stuff - really challenging but good to get to the bottom of it. Knock on effects of changing things - diving in and understanding. Trouble shooting with Okta and finding our own solution.

The most recent development in your career.
In the last six months has felt he's got a handle in a load of things - confidence in the knowledge built up - this has really gelled in the last six months - the penny dropping.
