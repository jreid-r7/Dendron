customer level endpoints removed because not being used and org level on the way

legacy endpoints calling user role app and access management app - scheduled for removal once org level in place and customers migrated

why not put a graphql end point on policy service?

allow products to self serve. create an epic where products can request a dedicated api if they can't get the performance from graphql.

can we read replica a single table?
