What defines good or worthwhile work?
Something that adds value to the product, something that improves the teams ability to work. Something that is enjoyable.

How does work relate to you, others, and society?
Each day is a new challenge, enjoys problem solving and keeping it interesting. 

What do experience, growth, and fulfillment have to do with work?
It's what a good job is all about - push you to do better, try new things, strive to get better. Team work, different output, etc. Without these it would be pretty boring and would be looking for something else.
