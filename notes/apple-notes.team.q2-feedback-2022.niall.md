Niall has worked well with others on the group sync feature including senior management, UX, UI and peers. Has shown flexibility in the face of changing requirements as well as the technical issues posed by interfacing with IDPs other than OKTA. It has been great to see the ownership that Niall has taken of the eIDP piece. There is strong evidence of lessons learned from other pieces of functionality that the team has developed over the last year or so and Niall has shown a commitment to small, tested deliverables. He has spent some significant time in the current project working through several issues - in particular the problems with Azure and passing in groups. Has produced PoCs and tested ideas.Â  Niall does not tend to leave things to chance. He has produced some decent documentation around the eIDP work showing an awareness of potential problems and risks. There has been plenty of opportunity for collaboration as the eIDP project has progressed

  

There is still opportunity to show leadership within the team in terms of ensuring tickets are dealt with on a priority basis and reducing the risk of rollover at the end of the sprint.

  

Niall is responsive to issues posted in the various Slack support channels. More than capable of providing support across the system.

  

With regard to general development it would be good to see more breakdowns of how particular problems have been solved - especially in the domain of the group sync work and IDPs. This would make an ideal basis for more in the way of tech talks, etc.
