## Priyal

Olivia has noticed some tension. Priyal isn't generally happy, feels that they don't work well together and that Cory talks down, interrupts and undermines her. Olivia has assigned dedicated work streams to each in an attempt to stop them knocking heads. For the last week they have been working together.

Priyal thinks Cory is trying to take the lion's share and isn't giving credit where it is due.

Olivia confident that she can identify and attribute Priyal's work to her. There are no concerns whatsoever about the quality of Priyal's work.

Cory's work is also good. There's no need for him to be attempting to compete or whatever.

Cory is the more difficult person to work with.
