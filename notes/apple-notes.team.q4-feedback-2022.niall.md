Niall has done good work this year - particularly with his approach to and delivery of the IDP Group Sync feature. He started the year  wanting to get involved in R&D for a feature. The group sync stuff was earmarked going into 2022. As a result this goal was achieved albeit with bumps along the way. Another goal remains to become senior. He is generally recognised as having a lot of experience in our systems and being a point of contact for RBAC.

  

Great to see the Group Sync feature released. Niall took this opportunity seriously and did good cross team work, using feedback and the advice and expertise of others to inform the work done. Going into group sync he was unfamiliar with SSO and the impact it might have.  He is proud to have delivered something that makes admin easier for SSO customers. No major issues have come out since the feature was released giving a positive aspect to the design and testing.

  

Okta was very much a black box and there was a lot of experimentation to find out what happens - adding an element of caution to what needed to be done. Niall has shown increased confidence to raise questions, throwing opinions out, and has felt much better at this over the last 18 months. From his own perspective not enough time dedicated to external learning. Finding time to do outside research and self learning can be tough and has been identified as a need within the wider team. I would encourage Niall to make sure this time is carved out and used effectively. There is still opportunity for tech talks to share on recent self development activities.

  

Definitely more evidence of empathy with the end user and it has been good to see the conversations happening. There is a continued need to look at the work being planned for the next quarter and for Niall to apply the insights and experience he gained from working on the Group Sync feature to the ongoing work in Org Level Roles. Most recently, he has initiated conversations with UX/UI around how we might display disabled products going forward. This has already raised some interesting ideas that we'll jump into more in 2023.

  

With the renewed look at estimation and the problems with rollover and team capacity, there is a real opportunity for Niall to make a difference here. He has already come up with the idea of estimating points related to Conditions of Satisfaction on a ticket. A good opportunity would be to really dig into this in 2023 and hold the team accountable for sloppy estimation and sloppy ticket design, when it arises.

  

  

  

What would make next year great? - difficult question due to where we are with RBAC. Org level roles will take as long as it takes. It can feel like he's topping out on domain knowledge but not adding new stuff or fresh ideas to it.

  

  

  

What between us what has worked? - communication is good, plenty of opportunity to chat. Things have been raised and dissatisfaction was addressed.

  

What is needed from me? - plenty of conversation.

  

Feedback for me - nothing specific, but preserve the relaxed format for the tech talks - don't allow people to be turned off. Sometimes it can be the cart before the horse with people being assigned.
