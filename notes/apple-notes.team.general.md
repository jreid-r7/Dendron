Involve Olivia with Gerald and Don re. probllem solving in support issues

Matthew B - when we engage with Ceara around UI/UX he should speak up and engage - think deeply around what needs to be done. What are the must haves and what are the nice to haves. see X-State

~~Eoin - wants some backend experience - maybe half way through. Talk again to Daniel about maybe switching~~

~~MSSP - just how big is it?~~

~~Do an ERD for [PLAT-16599](https://issues.corp.rapid7.com/browse/PLAT-16599 "View this issue")~~

~~Write PA ticket for access request automation~~
~~Kong RBAC api pass through ticket~~

~~Catch up with Tommy about AppSec RRNs~~

Start with GET - leave resourceSets till last
JR - go through api doc and come up with a planned sequence - simple -> complex
JP - think about order of other verbs

Slack standup - did everyone read everything? What worked with it? Did it achieve anything?

~~Dan - chat to Neville for assurance re. team. Chat to Grainne about expectation messaging~~

~~MyMoose comment to Oliva - too sensitive for a guitar pick~~

Do we validate that permissions have different ranks withing the same feature? We need a research task for feature/permission conflicting roles handling for sprint 6

~~Gather leave in a spreadsheet for Q2~~

Wednesday update - account migration status - how many?

DLQ Retention needs increased - for May. Is there a cost involved

Targetted in May - moving apps to EKS - if Matt J is interested we can negotiate moving people around on PA. 25 apps to be planned for, do some then handover. High priority. Matt says yes.

IO capacity with nodes and autoscaling.

Chat to Matt Budde about preferred solution for ERV display - do we create a little API taking org id, product code/tokens, feature/permissions and return a boolean OR should we use the UAP? Include Nial Dennison in this conversation.

Chat to Martin/Kay about chasing Ulrich for Jake's spot bonus

Chat to Chris about https://issues.corp.rapid7.com/browse/APPSI-2113
