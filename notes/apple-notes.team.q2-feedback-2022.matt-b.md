When available Matthew will be spearheading integration tests within platform home in light of the recent incidents such as [https://wiki.corp.rapid7.com/display/PM/Triage+issue+PLAT-16436+-+Product+admins+can%27t+access+user+management](https://wiki.corp.rapid7.com/display/PM/Triage+issue+PLAT-16436+-+Product+admins+can%27t+access+user+management) where its highlighted our crucial need for integration testing.

  

He has spoken about usage of gherkin syntax for these tests which he is going to push for. Shows very impressive interest and skills in testing. In particular this will make it simpler to translate business use cases to tests.

  

Matthew often shows a desire to pair with and help others which is great to see. He is gaining more knowledge in build tooling such as Webpack which is critical when it comes to debugging issues outside of his main focus area.

  

Matthew also identifies areas that will make the platform better for other engineers such as adding swagger documentation and highlights that we need this across the board in platform.

  

He should continue to explore other technologies and frameworks but pushes for change should be based on PoCs and the gathering of empirical evidence.
