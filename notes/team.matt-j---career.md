Had found the work monotonous and wanted a challenge. Wanted to do some UI work for a change and a challenge. Has thought about it and would like to be able to pick up bits of both. The idea of full-time UI was to use that to ramp up but would really like to be able to dip in and out.
Matt has spoken to Damien with regards to upcoming openings in Cloud Sec/DNR and he would interested in a senior opening there.
