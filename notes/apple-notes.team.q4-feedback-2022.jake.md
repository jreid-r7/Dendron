Has helped steer the v1 sunsetting and org level RBAC planning. Regular point of contact with questions related to peers research tasks . Does try to clearly outline  tradeoffs e.g. in the v1 sunsetting we had a couple of options for handling the legacy migration. Constantly building up my design experience and also learning from the feedback I get.

  

Seeing more evidence of attempts to apply learning gained from outside sources e.g. recent work on PRs and coding standards. Keen to get to grips with tech debt. I would encourage Jake to look at the trade offs between tight deadlines and burning down tech debt.

  

Has worked with UX and UI to come up with API contracts that will best suit their needs. I'm thinking ahead about empathy towards the developers of our codebase, not just our users. We maintain code more than we write it and we often stumble over sloppy work from the past. A more efficient set up means we can provide more value for our end users and we'll be less likely to throw problems their way.

  

With the early org level RBAC work and v1 sunsetting I have helped steer things in a direction that focuses on quality. I have also put a lot of effort into analysing existing complex areas of our codebase and I have been flagging these to members of the team with ideas of how we can either clean these up or avoid these kinds of messes in the future. This feeds into my efforts with ensuring clean code quality which is the foundation of any feature development, simple or complex. Most of our complex features are only complex because we're piling more on top of our riddled foundation.

  

I have expertise in Java, have picked up enough on Python, and I have a solid enough understanding of the core principles that I could pick up most other languages. I've identified many performance fixes in our queries, I am a big advocate of clean code and refactoring and I've used this experience to make our code as maintainable (and performant) as possible.

  

People often come to me with their problems and I help them. I take particular care with the work I deliver and I ensure that areas I touch are left in a tidier state than when I found them. I have identified and resolved numerous production issues this year and I've highlighted problematic areas that are likely to cause issues in the future.

  

I've been advocating for better standards on clean code and I'll be setting up a session in January Q1 2023 to discuss this with the team. I'll also be looking to set up a recurring Friday PR slot for Codecrafters / Gatekeepers / Crayolas to come together and share thoughts on particular PRs to help knowledge share and to show how we should make our code cleaner.

  

I have also been trying to lead by example with clean code practices in my PRs and giving more detailed feedback in the teams' PRs. My shift towards this focus in code quality has come about after I've realised that my previous push for micro-services -> macro-services will not come in the near future, so I'm trying to drive impact at the root of our complexity problem - our code.

  

I have pushed for tighter control of our documentation to keep things up to date and to clean up after ourselves. I've recognised that documentation can easily spiral out of control so I've introduced ADRs into our two RBAC services to help record our decision making.

  

I have worked closely with Niall Curry, UX and UI, worked quite a bit with AppSec and Ops, and I've worked with PD over this last quarter with various terraform issues. I am comfortable in coordinating cross-team and I've built up good relationships.

  

I've already mentioned trying to tackle the root of our complexity problem. I've been leading by example with cleaning up areas of code that we touch - I do this in the RBAC services, the other micro-services that I happen to work on, and in areas of the code I work in via PA. I have experience in most of the iPIMS micro-services and can traverse it easily enough.

  

I have a lot of domain expertise with RBAC and leverage this to make thoughtful design decisions in our upcoming feature development.

  

  

Jake started off 2022 wanting to get his voice heard more in the wider space and to bring more back to the team from his experience and findings in external research; to get the team in better shape and act with some more senior responsibilities. He has had some course correction to do in this with regards to fundamentals, design, etc. but has produced a tech talk on micro-services. This was well received but did not result in immediate value. He has taken a shift towards looking at clean code and has set up some Pull Request review sessions with the wider team. Jake has an understanding of the implications of tech debt and shows a passion to tackling this. I would encourage him to continue with this passion, but to continually attempt to align this with current goals and deliveries. There is real opportunity to show leadership in our planning and estimation processes where we can build in time to do self improvement and tackle tech debt.

  

Org level RBAC has been difficult with changes in requirements and cross team collaboration. Jake has helped steer the v1 sunsetting and org level RBAC planning. He is a regular point of contact with questions related to peers research tasks . Does try to clearly outline  tradeoffs e.g. in the v1 sunsetting we had a couple of options for handling the legacy migration.

  

Jake has been involved in conversations with the wider set of teams involved in the planning of a project like Org Level Roles. This exposure has been good and a lot of documentation has been produced. It is inevitable that in a project like this, documentation and designs can become out of date quite quickly and Jake realises this. I would encourage him to continue to keep an eye on the project documentation to ensure that tickets are based on the most current information available. The ADR initiative was a good step in this direction.

  

Jake remains a primary point of contact for the RBAC codebase. It's good to see his concern for reducing complexity and tech debt. He admits to struggling with trying to get into senior mindset with lots to balance and get around including development tasks and managing his time. As we move into 2023 I would encourage him to keep looking for opportunities to maximise impact and show leadership.

  

  

Goals for year: wanted to get his voice heard more in the wider space. To bring more back to the team, his experience and findings. To get the team in better shape and act with some more senior responsibilities. Some course correction with regards to fundamentals, design, etc. resulting in tech talk on micro-services but no immediate value. Has taken a shift towards clean code with the PR sessions. We have an issue with tech debt.

  

Most proud of: getting voice heard a bit more and getting involved, giving presentations and those were received well. Org level RBAC has been difficult, changes in requirements and cross team collaboration. Immediate impact in peers responding positively. Enjoys working well with others and a positive atmosphere. Hopes these initiatives will progressively add more value.

  

Struggles:  trying to get into senior mindset with lots to balance and get around including development tasks, balancing time. Keen to help, but can be hot-heated and speak his mind.

  

Transformation: GPS goal - well received micro-service presentation but won't pay off in the short term. Getting involved more and wanting to do it.

  

Great next year: hammering home collaboration in standards on platform and getting people excited. Getting a handle on the complexity platform. Org Level RBAC gets finished.

  

Company goals: helping steer the design and requirements sourcing, outlines, delivery timelines. Will push hard for this to be done the right way.

  

Worked for us: open and honest with each other. If we have problems we can let each other know and usually meet in the middle. Feels I trust him and help to keep him on track.

  

Need from me next year: Collaborate more with ideas and run them by me for input. GPS goals with design, etc.

  

Feedback for me: Keep ear to the ground and deal with issues/unhappiness. Watch retros for recurring items.
