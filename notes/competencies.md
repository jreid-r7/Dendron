# Competencies

## Driving Outcomes OVER Actions

### Strategic Doing

I think big and act small, breaking larger goals into smaller components by setting time-bound milestones, executing quickly, assessing progress, and pivoting where necessary to achieve meaningful outcomes.

### Accountability

I hold myself and others responsible for driving outcomes and meeting commitments that deliver value for the business and our customers by establishing ownership, roles/responsibilities, and clear expectations within teams and projects.

## Being Proactive OVER Reactive

### Navigating Change & Ambiguity

I am eager and open to understanding "why" a change is happening, how I can be an active driver of it, and focus forward vs. in the past.

### Decision-Making

I make efficient decisions that resolve challenges and enable momentum, integrating diverse perspectives and ensuring transparency in the process.

## Cultivating Commitment OVER Consensus

### Communication

I communicate in a clear manner that conveys my objectives and rationale, fostering commitment from others.

###  Cross-Functional Collaboration
I build a global network and work across boundaries to deliver sustainable improvements that create business & customer value.

### Managing Conflict

I embrace difficult conversations, actively listening, asking questions, and checking for understanding to find common ground.

### Self-Awareness

I apply a strong understanding of self (my strengths, weaknesses, biases etc.) in order to adapt to group dynamics and adjust my behaviors to optimize collective impact.
