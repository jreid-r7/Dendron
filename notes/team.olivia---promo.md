Alright, we have the Finance and SVP approval and you are good to communicate this promo to Olivia.  Few notes for the communication:  

- Because of comp cycle timing, this will be effective 1/1/24 but won't be processed for another few weeks, so Olivia will get retro pay once the change goes through.
- Only promo and base increase should be communicated now.
- Bonus payout, any stock grants, and performance review **cannot be communicated** yet and will need to be communicated during the standard communications timeframe of Feb 6th -15th.
- Base pay £52,000
- Senior Software Engineer
