High level goals: Didn't set specific goals but wanted to get back into the swing of things having only started in September. Wanted more experience and confidence in general. Feels that this has been achieved. Has worked with PD and wants to thinks they find her to be helpful and that there is a good relationship.

  

Most proud of: becoming more confident - technical decisions made. The legacy role design work has shown this.

  

Struggles: struggled to go outside topics in work and do external research.

  

Transformations: not sure of having taken risks, maybe hasn't taken enough. The stuff on PA around resilience and hystrix would be a risk. Has learnt a lot - a little bit of everything. How to write code well. Thinking about the performance aspects coupled with maintainability.

  

A great next year: excited about the prospect of a new project. Org Level Roles is an interesting project and looking forward to getting that done. RBAC is complex and hard to work with. Would like the object to start something and make it good from the start.

  

Worked well for us: enjoys the 121s and that I am approachable. Communication makes a good foundation.

  

What do you need from me for success: more time to do non sprint work

  

Feedback for me: just take on board the feedback we have - I do do that so no concerns, but keep it up.

  

  

Olivia started 2022 wanting to get back into the swing of things having only started in September. She wanted more experience and to generally build her confidence. It is clear that this has been achieved. She has been involved in cross team work, particularly with PD there seem to be good relationships building there. It has been good to see her becoming more confident with technical decisions made. The legacy role design work she did has shown this.

  

Olivia has a good understanding of majority of the system and has greatly improved her understanding of system performance this year. She would0 like to improve her knowledge of java and spring in general, and learn more about AWS features that we might not be utilising.

  

She has produced a lot of documentation this year in regards to planning, research & design. She will explore a number of different design decisions and make arguments for and against them. She will also pull in different people for their opinion when needed. Her documentation is detailed and well thought out and her ticket quality is also good. Olivia also shows very good attention to detail and retention of facts. This has proved extremely valuable when issues have arisen with Olivia recalling decisions made months ago.

  

Olivia is a valued member of the team with a widening impact. I look forward to 2023. Well done.
