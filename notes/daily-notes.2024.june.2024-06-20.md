# Ops Meeting
LogSearch work to support Org Level RBAC
Ops have an epic - Ilya to provide some technical input from their side
## Current work - product admin experience
We can't go live until the product admin experience is in place but we can't move until products have adopted the new endpoints
Some customers on RBAC V2 could be given the new experience but need the products on the new APIs
Some multi-org customers haven't been moved to V2 yet - migration scripts will need to be updated to the new APIs
4 MDR customers on V1 need moved to the Alert Triage experience - at least one of these will need to wait
## Steps
Migration APIs - not part of the estimate
In product Experience

Starting in two weeks - research spike this week
