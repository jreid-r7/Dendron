Frustration with sprints
- Not 10 days, lots of other things take away from work, ends up 7 days
- Should be 3 to 4 weeks - anything bigger is too big
- Think of MVP and deliver within 3-4 weeks. **Look up Kaizan**
- Big on date ranges - feature put forward and then estimated - e.g. team estimates 20-30 days
- Bring in the idea of confidence - high medium or low - high being something worked on before, medium or low for other
- Stand ups should query impacts on date ranges and date range should narrow e.d. 25-30, etc.
- Kaizan used to work out where things went wrong
- Kansan doesn’t tolerate defects. Defects need to be evaluated and will push out our early date.
- The board can be very powerful. Jira boards on screen aren’t as powerful as a physical whiteboard - these really show what is going on.
- Can have project swim lane and defect swimlane - either assign members to lanes or allow any to pick up next most important.
- Look up avatars - minimise context switching
- When a date is given the team becomes accountable and take ownership. The team gave the date so they need to dig in and make best effort to meet that date.  High priority defects may cause 
- With our current project make each strand a swimlane. Create Tass and then pull each task across the board
- People who finish in their swimlane can then tackle defects from the defect swimlane
- Before a project segment the team would take a day to work through the what and produce an estimate and outline
