Highlights
Working across the UX and PXE teams on accessibility standards for components (company wide). Now part of the accessibility advocates group.

Accomplishments
Setting up the new integration testing framework for platform - the ability to write and run tests including the Jenkins pipeline. Now working on the first ticket to actually implement tests.
Unblocking the delivery of the Group Sync UI experience. This was tied to the new SSO experience but they were able to pull the particular component out and integrate that with the existing SSO experience.
Creating and setting up coding standards for the new platform UI mono repo.

Issues/Frustrations
Concerned about data proximity - wants to introduce more effective paging within our UIs.

Next Steps
Wants to drive the UI/tool rewrite for the new Org Level Roles user experience. This is being worked on now with a focus on testing from the outset.

-   **  
    Very forward thinking, very positive attitude (Though has mentioned that some of his ideas don’t get implemented or there is no time allowed for implementation due to other priorities)**
-   **Code quality is generally good, very impressed with his mindset on testing and its importance. Has done great work on setting up cypress integration tests in the platform.**
-   **Active on Belfast JS and UX/UI channels when people query for help, Matthew often responds and points people in the right direction.**
-   **Is well informed (more than anyone else I’ve noticed) about the frontend ecosystem and the evolution of libraries and frontend techniques. If you talk to Matthew about techniques such as SSR, SSG, and functional reactive systems such as RxJS or SolidJS. Matthew will have heard of them and may even have used them.**
-   **Had the foresight to try and use a separate bundler that is less complex than webpack when bootstrapping the new rbac package. Though having hit some hurdles - often is on the right lines on how to solve those problems. Reaches out to others to ask for help at the right times to unblock himself.**
-   **Is very good at pair programming and communication, talking though problems. Takes feedback on very well.**

Areas I think Matthew could improve in (general improvements)Improvement in TypeScript, help enforcing type correctness in the codebase.  
Improvement in TS generics for reusable components.The feedback around TypeScript is not to say Matthew is bad at it, but I notice the team in general is new to TypeScript so it’s all a learning experience on using it effectively.
