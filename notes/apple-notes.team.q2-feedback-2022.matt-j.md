Matthew has a superb approach to his work. He has worked through some tricky tickets this quarter - with a particular shout out for his work on session limiting. This problem turned out to be much trickier than anticipated but he persevered and reached out for help and opinions as required before coming up with a relatively simple and elegant solution. It is great that Matthew doesn't just ask for help but also seeks opinions and to clarify his own assumptions.

  

Matthew isn't scared to advocate for change where he sees it as appropriate. He has been doing excellent work in his time on the PA sprint and has done excellent work in several areas, most recently on getting the integration test suite up and running.

  

Matthew is happy to take on roles like scrum master when offered and drives meetings well. He will challenge poorly defined tickets.

  

Matthew should continue to develop and deepen his understanding of RBAC and of the wider platform.
