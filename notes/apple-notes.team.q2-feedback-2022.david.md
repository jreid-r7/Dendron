David has had a great quarter and has continued to build his skills and knowledge while becoming a valuable team member. He partakes in meetings, contributes well and demos his work.Â 

  

For the remainder of this quarter he should concentrate on his buddy role with the new intern, continue to deliver feature work, but also his commitment to a tech talk.
