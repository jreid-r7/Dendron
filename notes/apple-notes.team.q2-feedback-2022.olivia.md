Olivia continues to grow in confidence. She exhibits a strong work ethic with a superb attention to detail. Her documentation remains outstanding.

  

It has been good to see Olivia take the initiative and start to look at potential problems in proposed solutions and to call and facilitate meetings to gain more insight into what has been decided and to point out potential pitfalls.

  

She took charge of some research for Phase 3 of the IDP group sync feature. This feature grew beyond the initial expectation with a lot of details to consider.

  

I would encourage Olivia to deepen and broaden her exposure to current industry trends and practises and to provide a tech talk on something that interests her.
