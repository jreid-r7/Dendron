What defines good or worthwhile work?
Really like doing work where she can learn something from it, or the rest of the team learns something. Finds research valuable as she is learning, opportunity to improve existing stuff.

How does work relate to you, others, and society?
It's good for personal development. It's a good thing to be working with people and getting points of view from everywhere.

What do experience, growth, and fulfillment have to do with work?
Experience makes life easier - knowledge, ability to solve problems. Lack of variety of experience can be a problem. Experience from outside brings new knowledge, new ways of approaching things.
Growth - linked to experience - more experience helps you grow. Same thing all the time, nothing new would stop growth.
Fulfillment - sometimes it's nice to just do something you know but not always satisfying. Getting your head round new.
