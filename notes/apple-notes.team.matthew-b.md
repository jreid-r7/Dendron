What defines good or worthwhile work?
90% of work is good or worthwhile if it is revisited and rreiterated. If you are aware enough that something isn't good enough. It's subjective - got over a hump, learned something new. Data supporting it.

How does work relate to you, others, and society?
Work is getting to play with cool things. Interested in how things work and digging into things. Like a hobby, getting to do what I want to do.
We pay the bills and keep a roof over our heads. A stable secure family.
Can contribute to society. The impact we have as a company with relation to cyber security.

What do experience, growth, and fulfillment have to do with work?
It's a cycle - through what we work on we learn, however minor, this breeds experience which leads to growth, never ends, learner for life. We need to work at our craft, be consistent. Fulfillment - impact on society etc. If by virtue of gaining experience and growing increases quality of life then that is fulfilling.

An early work experience that influenced you.
First job - weekend job for pin money - second manager in McDonalds treated everyone way better than the other managers, not like the stereotype fast food manager. He read people and indentified struggle and took the initiative to try and help.

An experience that drove your interests.
As a wee lad in P6 or P7, at granny's house and got to play on uncle's computer. He was there and working doing freelance web design. He made the first website for the Belfast Giants in Micromedia Fireworks. Decided to try it for himself. Thought it was what he wanted to do and that evolved over time. Seeing the site on a computer then appearing live on the web.

An achievement or high point in your development.
Has got quite good at looking at a piece of code and identifying antipatterns or code smells without relying on linting or static analysis. Seeing the potential problems and then bringing that up with the rest of the team.

A challenge or hurdle you overcame.
After seeing a website going live it took some time to play around and figure things out. Floated through school. Was working in Ikea, going to tech and Matthew Jr was born. Couldn't get contract increased. Got a new job with Sky Broadband for more hours and money. Three years passed but he bought a random online course for Rails fullstack dev. Spent an hour or so an evening for a couple of months. Was able to get out of the call centre and land a job in ShopKeep. Managed to get out of a dead end job.

The most recent development in your career.
Rapid7, switch from QA automation, basically the dream job.
