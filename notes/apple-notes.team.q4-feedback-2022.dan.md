Dan has had a solid first half to his internship. He shows a real willingness to get stuck into tickets and to be a part of the team. He has forged  good relationships with his peers and asks questions and seeks advice.

  

Dan shows a good grasp of the SDLC, he regularly commits code, raise code reviews, gets involved with testing, etc. In terms growth opportunity here it would be good to see some more involvement in other people's code reviews. He set out on his internship wanting to become more proficient, become ready to enter the software/technology world, to be able to breakdown new stuff to where it can be understood, or be ready to be researched further, to cement in what has been done in Uni and apply that to the real world. He is on track, or a good portion of the way there. Dan is currently working on improving sprint velocity and burn down although I would caution him to ensure that he has a fuller grasp of what is expected in a ticket before diving in.

  

Dan has been exposed to a wide range of technologies over the past six months or so and shows a good grasp of Java as well as having had some exposure to Python, Groovy, Flyway and SQL. He is getting to know his way around the RBAC/iPIMS codebase and understanding which repo or module is responsible for which are of functionality. He has learned a lot, even with general Java programming. The way he programmes now is very different from when he started e.g. moving from for loops to foreach. He had never used Spring before, or PostgreSQL. He has taken risks by picking up tickets where there isn't a full understanding as this is a good chance to learn. He is justifiably proud of the work he did with Flyway and the bug with free trials which he worked on.

  

Dan is working on his communication skills and feels that sometimes he doesn't paint a clear image of what he's trying to solve/do when explaining something code related for example. There's not just the programming language itself but also the language of programming. While there is still work to do I am satisfied with the progress being made.

  

Dan definitely accepts feedback well and graciously. There have been some incidences of repeated mistakes and Dan should seek to avoid repeats of those. This would be the main area of opportunity for growth.  Dan will pick up tickets and have a go. He could be more deliberate in seeking out background and discussing a possible approach before starting work. This does not override the idea of working things out on your own but can help avoid misunderstanding and avoidable rework.

  

Dan should continue to get more familiarity with the code base so that tickets are more accessible and require less research or help.

  

Worked well for us - 121s have gone well and good to know where he is at and where to improve. Feedback is useful and the fortnightly cadence is useful.

  

What is needed for success - keep up the feedback. Feedback on coding.

  

Feedback for me - nothing.
