Have put a real focus into getting better at writing clean, readable and maintanable code and believe I am able to do so at a good standard.

As time has went on and my understainding of the code base, and our dev process has developed I have tried to ensure that everything is done correctly.

I feel as if I have become self sufficient in more then areas of the codebase/ platform such as: Legacy Role Assignement RBAC, Log in Process, Group Sync, Lambda

  

Through the year during some the major prod issues we have encountered I have grown a lot more configent in indentifying issues and helping with solutions.

During the year I have been scrum master on a few occasions which has given me confidence on running planning sessions and giving meningful points during planning

Have completed  a few small-medium projects throughout the year from start to finish and have helped where nesscessary on others.

Through the year suring some the major prod issues we have encountered I have grown a lot more configent in indentifying issues and helping with solutions.

Have focused on improving this skill throughout the year.

During some of my work this year I have had to spend some time looking into how specifc bits of work have been utilised throughout the industry and try and see if that works for us. i.e Lambda, Micrometer, K8s Autoscaling. Still have to give a tech talk but will make a point in 2023 of doing more of these.

Try to do this as much as possible although sometimes its hard as i feel at times that we don't have great communication with the users/product teams on what their pain points are.

Think I do this well but hard to gauge. Probably some room for improvement here

This has been something that I have naturally found myself doing as my understanding of Platform/ RBAC has Increased. If there is something I think could be a risk I always do my best to call it out as much as possible.

Still yet to do a Tech Talk, one is on the way. I ahve written a few wikis throughout the year and written some design docs but room here to do more.

Try to do this as much as possible, no point wasting time trying to figure something out when I can ask

I have gotten better as time has went on. Try to do as much as I can but sometimes I do just have a quick glance over some PRs and reviews instead of trying to understand it fully and give meaniful feedback. This is something now that we are really trying to focus on as a team so I feel this will improve.

Have worked with PD, PM and Dev throughout the year to get work done as much as I have needed to. Haven't worked with UX yet.

I feel I do this but most likely could do this better. Maybe reading through more tnew tickets before planning could help

I try to do this where nesscessary but can'r rememember having to do this a whole lot. Maybe all the work I have done with PD counts?

Having more time in the team has defiently helped me do this although not sure if you would say I "Own" a key component of the codebase.

  

  

Matthew started the year wanting to get more familiar with codebase and get more involved in the work, to get a foothold in the team before next steps. He has made excellent progress and is more comfortable chatting about things, thinking about design and how it impacts others and using that to inform judgements when writing code.

  

Early in the year he tackled some work on user sessions which involved a deep dive into Spring code. He had no experience with this but jumped into Spring Boot and was able to reach a successful solution. He has also engaged in some Lambda work which was also completely new to him. He work very hard on this and although it took longer than expected he made real performance gains which will be of interest to the wider team. Matthew states that he wanted to come to R7 to improve and is proud of the Java code produced there as well as the performance increases. He has also enjoyed being able to work with Terraform and the new UAP composer.

  

Matthew takes responsibility for his work and is conscientious. He admits that he needs to not rush as much when writing code, to put the PR up when an extra half hour might have caught issues. However there has been the progress in writing more legible and maintainable code. He is starting to think about what we design in terms of budget - the cost implications of scaling etc. This is great to see and to be encouraged.

  

Going into 2023 Matthew is thinking of getting AWS certification. Hi is also starting to think about pushing on to the next level of his career - working towards senior.  It has been great to see the impact that Matthew has made over the past year. Well done.

  

  

High level goals: get more familiar with codebase and get more involved in the work. Getting a foothold in the team before next steps. Has made good progress and is more comfortable chatting about things, thinking about design and how it impacts others. Using that to inform judgements when writing code.

  

Most proud of: work on the user sessions. Had no experience here and got jumped into Spring Boot and was able to get it working. The Lambda was completely new. Wanted to come to R7 to improve and is proud of the Java code produced there as well as the performance increases. Also small things like being able to work with Terraform and the new UAP composer.

  

Where did you struggle: to not rush as much when writing code. Can be in a rush to put the PR up when an extra half hour might have caught issues. Encourage to complete his tech talk.

  

Transformed: biggest has been the progress in writing more legible and maintainable code. Starting to think about what we design in terms of budget - cost implications of scaling etc.

  

Great next year: Getting AWS certification. Would love to start thinking about pushing on to the next level of his career - working towards senior. If at the end of 2023 he can look back and see things he has worked on has taken things to a higher level - scalability, performance, ways of working. That the team is x times better.

  

What has worked well between us? Enjoyed 121s and found them beneficial - that they make him think about what he is doing. Enjoyed being scrum master and the conversations about how to make that better.

  

What do you need to be set up for success? Nothing major, maybe more cadence on traffic lights.

  

Feedback for me: nothing for now.
