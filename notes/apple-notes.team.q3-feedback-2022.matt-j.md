Highlight - nothing in particular but has been a good quarter in terms of progressing things. Making a start on integrations tests, learning about and tidying up in orchestration app. Own understanding has grown and things are making much more sense in terms of what they do and where stuff comes from.

Achievement - As above

Opportunities - still wants to get going on AWS certification. As far as work is concerned is getting a good spread and happy with the variety.

Matt shows real initiative when digging into issues. He's not scared to pursue something into other areas like infrastructure, etc. Shows perserverance in the face face of problems.

Matt works well with his peers, asks questions, makes suggestions and gives advice. It has been a storn quarter.
