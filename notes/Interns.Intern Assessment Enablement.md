## Review the structure

Month 3 (soon) & Month 6 (end of January) - proper assessment forms with evaluation

Month 9 - final evalutaion

Last year 9-boxes had everyone in the top right, evaluation meetings re-asessed. 

## Assessment improvements

New scale of 1 to 5 and it is broader. More examples being given of what each level should look like.

We will be asked for much more detailed feedback and more justification of a level will be required.

Calibration meetings will be set up from 3 months rather than just 6 and 9. Outsiders will be brought in to remove bias. Use the skills profiles.

## Next Steps

We will receive assessments today to be completed by next Monday (14th October) EOD. Assessments will be shared with practice leads (Kay Gemmert, Simon Irwin PD) middle of next week.
