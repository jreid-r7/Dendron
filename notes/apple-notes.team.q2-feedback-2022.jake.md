Jake is well engaged on the support channels and on project work. He shows a good level of engagement and leadership with the rest of the team. It had been hoped that we would get started on the Org Level Roles project in the coming quarter but that has been parked, however Jake has produced some good analysis and documentation around this project showing flexibility of thought and consideration of impact as well as thinking on how to split this project into smaller chunks of work.

  

Following on from previous development goals and in response to his GPS, Jake has been diving into our architecture and has produced. some good write-ups and has done a presentation on how we could potentially revisit and improve our micro service architecture. I would encourage him to keep up the pressure on this and think about how we could adopt and implement some of his findings in a way that would benefit the system and also his fellow developers.

  

It would be good to see some more PoC work this quarter along with evidence gathered illustrating expected benefits of changes building a case to allow work to proceed.
